			<h2 style="text-align: center;">EATING MINDFULLY</h2><p style="text-align: center;">Healthy eating is not only what you eat but also how you eat it. Here are some tips:</p>
			<ul>
			<li> Whenever possible eat at the table, avoid eating on the go or in front of the TV. Make each meal a pleasurable experience, where you can concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of your delicious food.</li>
			<li>Take your time. Pause briefly between bites; this will not only make eating a better experience but also kick-start the digestion process.</li>
			<li>Chew carefully. Depending on the texture of the food it can take up to 30 chews to properly chew your food.</li>
			<li>Take smaller mouthfuls. This will increase the taste stimuli in your mouth. Don’t take a new spoonful unless the previous one has been swallowed.</li>
			<li>Avoid distractions during the meal. Put your phone away and enjoy what is on your plate.</li>
			<li>Eat only what is on your plate. Make sure you have only one portion to avoid overeating</li>
			<li>When you cook yourself, you know exactly what is on your plate. As much as possible choose unprocessed, natural single ingredient foods. Add spices and fresh herbs to your dishes for more flavor</li>
			<li>Beware of any additional ingredients added to jars or tins; they usually contain a lot of salt, sugar, and preservatives. A sauce or herb mixture is easy to make yourself, therefore natural and healthier than shop alternatives.</li>			
			</ul>

Even better when planing and preparing food for the next day or two which will also save us time in the kitchen. Making snacks that are easy to take with us on the go so that we are not tempted to grab whatever when hunger strikes will also help us stick to the plan</p>
			<p style="text-align: left"> Losing weight doesn’t mean you will be hungry, not being prepared does. Stick around for some simple recipes but first let’s take a dive in nutrition.</p><p style="text-align: center">Having good nutrition is simple when you know what you need and you understand your options. We will take a look at protein, carbs and healthy fats and also at portion control and then we will put it all together in simple customizable recipes..</p><p style="text-align: center">Knowing what to eat is only half the battle when it comes to healthy nutrition...you also have to know how much to eat. Over time, food and drink portions have increased in size. And the more food we’re served on the plate, the more food we consume, which leads to overeating.</p><p style="text-align: center">With this awareness, and by having a guide to manage portion sizes, we can eat foods in a healthy, balanced way; building a better relationship around what we put into our body. A simple, effective and proven method is the Hand Portion Method. The idea is that you’re not measuring or weighing your food using technology, but rather using your own hand to gauge the size of the portion. Your hands are proportional to your body, and they go where you go. This makes them the perfect tool to quickly, and easily gage your portion size, even when you’re eating out.This method is for anyone who struggles with the idea of using food tracking apps and meal logs. It’s the perfect way to build any meal, with a habit-centric approach. To get started, try each of the next steps.</p>
